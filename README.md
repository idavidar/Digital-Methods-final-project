# US Abortion Debate: how do different groups frame the abortion issue?
Group project by Ida Vidar Kristensen, Faridoddin Pesteh and Ana Radomirescu
## Introduction
Research question: In our group project we worked on how different groups/organizations in the US discussed and framed the “abortion issue” specifically during and after the overturning of Roe v. Wade on the 24th of June 2022. We wanted to look at different American organizations that fight for different issues and see how they framed the subject. We wanted first and foremost to look at the distinction between pro-choice and pro-life groups (which clearly have different stances on the matter), but also at how other relevant equity seeking groups and religious groups frames the issue, and whether they speak about the issue in a way that promotes and reflects the subject they normally lobby for. 
We have chosen to examine the tweets of 10 organizational accounts affiliated with 5 different subgroups (50 groups in total:
- Pro-choice (pro-abortion)
- Pro-life (anti-abortion)
- LGBTQ2S+ groups (organizations seeking for people with different sexual orientations, genders etc.)
- Minority groups (here specifically racial minorities. So groups that fight for the rights of afro-americans, Latino-americans and asian-americans).
- Religious groups (groups representing the different religions who represent the american population - christians, catholics, jewish, muslim etc.)
