# US Abortion Debate: how do different groups frame the abortion issue?
Group project in Digital Methods by Ida Vidar Kristensen, Faridoddin Pesteh and Ana Radomirescu
## Introduction
Research question: In our group project we worked on how different groups/organizations in the US discussed and framed the “abortion issue” specifically during and after the overturning of Roe v. Wade on the 24th of June 2022. We wanted to look at different American organizations that fight for different issues and see how they framed the subject. We wanted first and foremost to look at the distinction between pro-choice and pro-life groups (which clearly have different stances on the matter), but also at how other relevant equity seeking groups and religious groups frames the issue, and whether they speak about the issue in a way that promotes and reflects the subject they normally lobby for. 
We have chosen to examine the tweets of 10 organizational accounts affiliated with 5 different subgroups (50 groups in total:
- Pro-choice (pro-abortion)
- Pro-life (anti-abortion)
- LGBTQ2S+ groups (organizations seeking for people with different sexual orientations, genders etc.)
- Minority groups (here specifically racial minorities. So groups that fight for the rights of afro-americans, Latino-americans and asian-americans).
- Religious groups (groups representing the different religions who represent the american population - christians, catholics, jewish, muslim etc.)
### Historical background
The contextual background of our analysis is the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe vs. Wade on June 24th 2022, and thus removing abortion as a constitutional right throughout the US. After the overturnment it is now up to the politicians in each individual state to determine the states laws on abortion - this decision has so far entailed that 12 states have made total abortion bans and that many other states have tightened their abortion policies. 
The timeline of the events can be seen below. 
- 1973: Roe vs. Wade was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court (1973: Abortion was legalized throughout the US
- May 3rd, 2022: Leaked Draft: On May 3, a leaked draft opinion by Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito indicated that the Court would strike down the landmark Roe v. Wade decision, which guaranteed federal constitutional protections of abortion rights.
- June 24th, 2022: Roe vs. Wade overturned by the Supreme Court: Abortion is no longer a constitutional right. 

## Data Collection
### Search query
We have chosen to examine data from the social media Twitter, since we expect the subject of abortion to be heavily discussed here. Furthermore we wish to examine the framing from different organizational groups which are often very active on this particular media.
Seach query:
- NB: NEEDS TO INSERT PICTURE OF SEARCH QUERY
- Words included in query: We tried to capture as many of the tweets made by these accounts about the abortion debate as possible. We did this by including more obvious terms as “abortion” and “Roe” (referring to the specific supreme court decision), but also more general words (birth, pregnant etc.), that we assume to be related to this debate in our specific time period. We have made several changes in our query - for instance removing “supreme court” from the query, since we saw that some of the tweets extracted using this term referred to other decisions made by the supreme court, that were not related to abortion. Based on the qualitative checks of tweets we have made, we feel quite confident that the words remaining in our query provides us with tweets which are relevant for our project. 
- Time period: We chose to look a the time period from a couple of days before it was leaked that the SC was going to overturn Roe vs. Wade (May 1st) and until today (16th of November). We chose this time period to be able to see if there were some interesting developments in the debate over time, and also since abortion has been an important issue again at the Midterm elections in November. 
- Language: We only chose tweets written in English.
