# US Abortion Debate: how do different groups frame the 'abortion issue'?
Group project in Digital Methods by Ida Vidar Kristensen, Faridoddin Pesteh and Ana Radomirescu
## Introduction
2022 has been a tumultuous year for the abortion debate in America. With the Supreme Court overturning *Roe v. Wade*, a ruling that provided the constitutional right to abortion, in June this year, the legal battle has been [shifted to states](https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-abortion-ruling-states-a767801145ad01617100e57410a0a21d). Groups on both sides of the debate have fiercely campaigned and [protested](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_abortion_protests) for their causes.

Our group project analyses how different groups/organizations in the United States discussed and framed the 'abortion issue' on Twitter, specifically since the leaked Supreme Court draft opinion on *Dobbs v. Jackson* which sought to overturn *Roe*. We looked at American groups that fight for a variety of social issues to see how they framed the subject. First and foremost, we were interested in the framing differences between pro-choice and pro-life groups (which clearly have different stances on the matter). Further, we wanted to see how other relevant equity-seeking groups and religious groups frame the issue of abortion: whether their chosen framing promotes and reflects their stance on the social issue that is their main focus, and whether or not certain groups use similar framing.

We chose to examine the tweets of 5 types of groups, and selected 10 organizational accounts representing each group (50 accounts in total):
- Pro-Choice groups (pro-abortion)
- Pro-Life groups (anti-abortion)
- LGBTQ2S+ groups (organizations seeking equity for people with different sexual orientations, genders etc.)
- Racial minority groups (organisations that fight for the rights of African-americans, Latino-americans and Asian-americans).
- Christian religious groups (Catholics, Protestants, and Mormons)

### Expectations
- NB: I (Ida) don't know if this is relevant, but maybe be should write a bit about our expectations for the analysis and why we have chosen these specific subgroups a bit more in detail? Let me know what you think :) 

### Historical background
The contextual background of our analysis is the Supreme Court's decision to overturn *Roe v. Wade* on June 24th 2022, removing abortion as a constitutional right throughout the US. This left it up to the individual states to determine the local laws on abortion. As of 12 December 2022, [13 states instituted total abortion bans and many others have tightened their abortion policies](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/us/abortion-laws-roe-v-wade.html). 

The timeline of the events: 
- 1973: The US Supreme Court decision on *Roe v. Wade* made abortion a constitutional right throughout the US.
- 2022, May 3rd: a leaked draft majority opinion of the Supreme Court in Dobbs v Jackson indicated that the Court would overturn *Roe v. Wade*.
- 2022, June 24th: *Roe v. Wade* overturned by the Supreme Court: abortion is no longer a constitutional right.

## Data Collection
### Search query
We chose to collect data from Twitter, a popular social media platform, because i) we expect the subject of abortion to be heavily discussed there, ii) the types of groups we chose to analyse are often very active on this platform, and iii) their interactions are public.

Below is an example of the seach query we used (in this case, for the Pro-Choice group):

<img width="442" alt="Skærmbillede 2022-12-17 kl  14 13 30" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115983285/208243628-fa2fb39f-9963-4d92-b42f-df7e049a7db5.png">


- Words included in query: We tried to capture as many of the tweets made by these accounts about the abortion debate as possible. We did this by including more obvious terms as “abortion” and “Roe” (referring to the specific Supreme Court decision), but also more general words (birth, pregnant etc.), that we assume to be related to this debate in our specific time period. We have made several changes in our query - for instance removing “Supreme Court” from the query, since we saw that some of the tweets extracted using this term referred to other decisions made by the Supreme Court, that were not related to abortion. Based on the qualitative checks of tweets we have made, we feel quite confident that the words remaining in our query provides us with tweets which are relevant for our project. 
- Time period: We chose to look a the time period from a couple of days before it was leaked that the Supreme Court was going to overturn Roe vs. Wade (May 1st) and until today (16th of November). We chose this time period to be able to see if there were some interesting developments in the debate over time, and also since abortion has been an important issue again at the Midterm elections in November. 
- Language: We only chose tweets written in English. 
### How did we chose our groups?
Our choosing of groups within each of our 5 different subgroups where dependent on several things. We searched the internet for relevant American groups/organizations within each of our 5 subgroups. Then we search these groups on Twitter and looked at a number of relevant factors: most importantly how many followers they had and how active they had been on Twitter in our time period (prioritizing accounts that actually tweet). We then chose the 10 groups we wanted to include within each of our subgroups.
The selection of our total of 50 groups gives us a total corpus of tweets of around 10.000 tweets. 
- NB: INSERT TABLE WITH NUMBER OF TWEETS FOR EACH GROUP WHEN NEW DATASET IS FINAL
- However, when we look at the corpuses within each of the subgroups, some of the corpuses are very small. Of couse both the pro-choice and pro-life groups have tweeted alot on our subject within our time period since this is their main policy-focus (5672 and 3750 tweets respectively), and our search query captures around 50-60% of these groups total tweets in the time period.
- But when looking at the remaining sub-groups (LGBTQ+, Minority Groups and Religious Groups) there is very few tweets about the abortion issue within our time period - these tweets only make up about 5% of the total number of tweets within this time period from the accounts. This however makes sense, since these organizations focuses’ are not the abortion issue, so they propably only tweet on this subject very rarily in relation to big events such as the day of the overturning of Roe v. Wade (but maybe then not that much afterwards). 

## Analysis approach
We have 5 different data corpuses representing our five different subgroups. Within each of these 5 corpuses we extracted the top 100 terms (monograms forbidden) and hashtags used in the tweets about abortion. We then manually cleaned these list to make sure that there were no duplicates and putting together terms that were clearly connected but not captured by Cortext (e.g. "#Roevwade" and "#Roevswade"). We also extracted the top 10 tweets made in each corpus based on the number of likes the tweets got. 
This data will be used to say something about how the different subgroups discuss and frame the abortion debate, and will make it easy to see if some of the groups use similar/very different framings.
In the following paragraphs we will present the 10 most frequently used terms and hashtags used by each of the subgroups when discussing the abortion issue in addition to some of the most liked tweets from each of the corpuses to try to illustrate the narratives in these tweets. 

## Empirical results
### Pro-Choice groups
#### Most frequent terms

<img width="655" alt="Skærmbillede 2022-12-17 kl  18 04 55" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115983285/208253136-af2286ef-078b-4545-a624-8248cabff9ee.png">

When looking at the top 10 most frequent used terms in the tweets from the Pro-Choice corpus, they naturally first and foremost refer to the specific case and the fact that an "abortion ban" is going to be passed in several states also mentioning specifically the "Supreme Court". Hereafter, it is worth noticing that the issue is almost always mentioned using the terms "rights", "freedom" or "care". This shows that they strongly frame the issue of abortion as a fundamental human right, and that they believe that the overturning of Roe vs. Wade will have consequences for both the care and health of pregnant women. All in all, these terms highly align with the expected stances of these Pro-choice groups. Actually, the Pro-choice groups often prefer to be called Pro-Reproductive Rights, since they find this term less polarizing. This is also reflected in their most frequent used terms, where the word "reproductive" recurs several times. 

#### Most frequent hashtags

<img width="646" alt="Skærmbillede 2022-12-17 kl  18 04 41" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115983285/208253157-859ce3c2-b842-4db2-94ef-bdc788b01057.png">

When moving on to the top 10 most frequent hashtags from the Pro-Choice groups there is again a clear focus on freedom, which is obviously an essential aspect of the abortion discussion that pro-choice groups often highlight. This can be seen in the 3 most frequent hashtags #fightbackforfreedom, #bansoffourbodies and #reprofreedomvoter. Then again there is also clearly some use of hashtags linking the tweets to the specific case such as #scotus, #roevwade and #roe. Furthermore, there on of the most frequently used hashtags are #whpa which refers to the socalled Women's Health Protection Act. The WHPA is a piece of federal legislation proposed by the House of Representatives multiple times the last 10 years trying to expand the abortion rights established in Roe vs. Wade to protect the right to access abortion care throughout the US, even in case of an overturnment of Roe vs. Wade. The WHPA was proposed by Democrats in the House and passed through the House (which had a Democratic majority) in early 2022, but was rejected by the Senate (which did not have a Democratic majority) in both February and on May 3rd 2022 - the same day of the leaked draft from the Supreme Court. The organizations use this hashtag in tweets both right when the WHPA was blocked by the Senate, but also throughout our entire period of investigation to highlight how important it is, to vote Democratic in the midterms election in November, since this could flip the majority in the Senate and making the WHPA possible to pass. This can for instance be seen in this specific tweet på the organization NARAL Pro-Choice America, who tweeted the following on July 15th:
- “These anti-choice Republicans just voted against #WHPA. We know who’s to blame for this abortion access crisis—and we won’t forget in November. Join us and help mobilize #ReproFreedomVoters across the country”

#### Top tweets

In the picture below we have illustrated 4 of the top 10 most liked tweets in the Pro-Choice corpus. These four tweets clearly illustrates the framing of the issue also shown in the terms and tweets above, but also the different events that occured in our time period of investigation. The tweet by Planned Parenthood in the bottom right of the picture is made on the very day where the leaked draft came out, and it was annouced that the Supreme Court would overturn Roe vs. Wade. Here Planned Parenthood is trying to inform people, that it is still possible to access abortions and where to find help. The two tweets in the top are both from the specific dates where the overturnment was finally passed in the Supreme Court, and therefore have a much more angry and indignant tone. The last tweet chosen in the bottom left is from the end of our time period (November) and nicely shows the sugsequent process of the overturnment, where the different states now suddenly have to make their own laws about abortion.

### Pro-Life groups
#### Most frequent terms

<img width="647" alt="Skærmbillede 2022-12-17 kl  18 04 09" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115983285/208253169-e38a575e-1f43-4544-8668-7c8c01d2c6bc.png">

When looking at the 10 most frequent terms used by the Pro-Life groups it is clear that their framing of the abortion issue is, as expected, highly different from the Pro-Choice groups. Instead of framing abortion in terms of "rights" and "care" as the Pro-Choice groups, the Pro-Life organizations use terms such as “abortion extremism”, “abortion industry” and "abortion on demand" suggesting that the abortion rules has gotton out of hand, and that it has been way to easy to access abortion "on demand". Interestingly, there is also a frequent mention of Planned Parenthood, suggesting a clear targeting of the organization by pro-life groups. The most frequently used term by these group is "pregnancy centers" which refers to pregnancy resource centers (sometimes also known as Pro-Life pregnancy centers) established by anti-abortion groups to persuade pregnant women to chose other options than abortion by providing support, guidance, diapers etc. In their tweets these centers are often mentioned as a response to the critisism of the Pro-Lifers not wanting to give options for pregnant women. In relation to this, a lot of these tweets also refer to specific situations where Pro-Choice demonstrators have blocked or vandalized these pregnancy centers around the US as a reaction to the overturnment of Roe v. Wade. A last term worth mentioning is "human life", which is also essential in understanding the differences between the Pro-Choice and Pro-Life organizations when it comes to the abortion issue. An important argument for the Pro-Life organizations is that an unborn fetus already from conception should be considered a human life with rights on equal terms with the pregnant mother. 

#### Most frequent hashtags

<img width="655" alt="Skærmbillede 2022-12-17 kl  18 10 14" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115983285/208253328-e35d2481-ea5c-411b-a510-0ea9ee6dff37.png">

The framing shown in the above-mentioned terms list is further enhanced when looking at the top 10 hashtags. Here it becomes even more clear that the Pro-Life groups indeed see the abortion issue as a matter of protecting the rights of the unborn human lifes with the hashtags #prolife, #lifeisahumanright and #lifewins22. Both the Pro-Life and the Pro-Choice groups are referring to rights when discussing the subject, just with focus on rights for different groups of people (unborn children vs mothers). The hashtag #cantstaysilent is used as part of a movement where Pro-Life organizations encouraged women who have earlier had an abortion (primarily forced by their partners) to share how this has affected their life and what regret and trauma it has caused in their life. An example of such a tweet can be seen below, where a woman uses her abortion story to try to convince others to give their babies up for adoption instead of having an abortion:
- "I had an abortion with my first pregnancy on October 26, 1985. I had it on a Saturday morning & then went to my cousin's wedding that evening!! Since my abortion I had two other children, a girl and a boy, and I…put both of them up for adoption. I am 58 years old now. My birth daughter is 32, and my birth son is 31, & I keep in touch with both of them. I can't tell you the joy I feel over seeing my 2 birth children, & the depression I feel (& the tears I have cried) over the one child I aborted. #CantStaySilent"

The rest of the most frequent hashtags are primarily references to the specific case such as #scotus, #supremecourt, #roevwade and #dobbsvjackson which was the case that overturned Roe vs. Wade. 

#### Top tweets

The picture below illustrates 3 of the most liked tweets on the abortion issue by the Pro-Life groups. As evident in both the terms and hashtags, here it is also clear, as seen in the tweet by Student for Life of America, that they see the overturnment of Roe vs. Wade as a victory and something to celebrate. In addition to this, the tweet from March for Life also shows that a great deal of the communication in the debate is directed towards the antagonist Pro-Choice groups. A frequently used pro-abortion argument is that abortion and family planning makes it easier for women to pursue both education and career opportunities, since they won't be forced to stay at home with their children. However, in this specific tweet March for Life tries to counter-argument this classical feministic argument by saying that women can easily be succesfull without having abortions.

### Minorty groups
#### Most frequent terms

<img width="645" alt="Skærmbillede 2022-12-17 kl  18 24 56" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115983285/208253899-cf40f88b-75f8-4f6d-8199-b6a222514890.png">

We are now turning towards the 10 most frequently used terms by the organizations fighting for racial minorities. At first sight, we see that these racial equity seeking groups use a framing much more similar to the Pro-Choice groups than the Pro-Life groups, since they also have several terms that refers to the issue as a “rights” issue” and also often mention the subsequent “abortion bans” that have taken place in many states since the overturnment of Roe vs. Wade. In addition to this, it is worth noticing that these groups actually do refer to the abortion issue in a way that highlights the issues they normally lobby for - here the racial minorities. This is clearly seen since some of the most frequently used terms are “Black people”, “Black women” and “racial justice issue”. They specifically frame the abortion issue as an issue for the black community and the black women. 

#### Most frequent hashtags

<img width="638" alt="Skærmbillede 2022-12-17 kl  18 26 48" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115983285/208253974-e8fddf20-0d67-4ca4-b85e-a085f47f9cfa.png">

Also when looking at the 10 most used hashtags by these racial minority groups we see some of the same hashtags used as by the pro-choice groups, namely #bansoffourbodies which is a prominent hashtag in both groups. In general, these minority groups have a big focus on the right to make decisions about your own body, which is clearly shown in several other of hashtags such as #liberatedbodies and #bodilyautonomy. Although not as evident as in the terms list, the racial equity agenda is also represented in the hashtags through #aapi which stands for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, who are specifically mentioned in some of the tweets as for instance the one illustrated below:
- "#ReproductiveRights are a civil & human right. This is all our responsibility.At @NAPAWF & @EthnicMediaSvc's briefing, our President & Executive Director @johncyangdc discussed what is at stake for the #AAPI community if Roe v. Wade is overturned"

Also the hashtag #nodataforcops illustrate that these groups have a focus on protecting the racial minorities from discrimination in relation to the abortion issue. The tweets using this hashtags argue, that the big tech companies should make sure that the police are not able to have data on which women are pregnant or has previously had abortions, since this can lead to further discrimination of especially racial minority women. Here, the organizations primary focus on racial equity is again very clear. 

#### Top tweets

Below we show 3 of the 10 most liked tweets made by these minority groups on the abortion issue. Generally, the indications from the terms and hashtags that these groups uses similar framing as the Pro-Choice groups are confirmed when looking at the tweets. All 3 tweets indicate harm and concern with the Supreme Court’s decision. 2 of the 3 tweets have a clear focus on framing the issue in relation to the rights of black americans and how this will especially affect this group, but as the tweet on the bottom left indicate they also highligh how it will affect other minority groups namely sexual minorities. 

Another thing worth noticing is that all the top 10 tweets are made from accounts that fight for the equity and rights of black americans. 
However, it makes sense that these groups have the highest reach and thereby the most likes, since there has been an increased focus on the rights of black people in recent years with the killing of George Floyd and the onset of the Black Lives Matter demonstrations. But as we previously saw in the hashtag list, the other racial minorities such as Asian Americans are also framing the issue in a way that reflects the group they are fighting for. 

<img width="1040" alt="Skærmbillede 2022-12-18 kl  15 34 15" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115983285/208304232-567a4f54-c8b8-4e0a-9053-12ef3464f41a.png">

### LGBTQ2S+ groups
#### Most frequent terms

<img width="628" alt="Skærmbillede 2022-12-17 kl  18 30 28" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115983285/208254176-f4005100-2fbb-489e-933b-5b5a983d94a7.png">

We now turn towards the 10 most frequently used terms by the LGBTQ2S+ groups that fight for the rights of people with different sexualities, genders etc. Here it is prevalent that the framing of the abortion issue by these groups is highly aligned with that of the Pro-Choice groups since 7 of the 10 terms overlap. As the Pro-Choice groups, and also the racial minority groups, they frame the issue in terms of “rights”, “care” and “health”. They clearly perceive abortion as an indisputable “reproductive right”, which is important for health concerns. As well as the racial minority groups they also have some group-specific terms on their top 10 list namely “trans people” and “LGBTQ+ rights”. This again exemplifies that these groups talk about the issue in a way that highlights their own target audience and how they will be affected by the overturnment of Roe vs. Wade. 

#### Most frequent hashtags

<img width="619" alt="Skærmbillede 2022-12-17 kl  18 33 19" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115983285/208254182-69ad3cb1-e279-4a38-b421-82c37d5dc24c.png">

When looking at the 10 most frequent hashtags of the LGBTQ2S+ groups there is also a notable overlap with the Pro-Choice and racial minority groups in the use of the #bansoffourbodies hashtag. These groups also use the #WHPA and thus refer to the Women Health Protection Act previously mentioned which could secure the abortion rights throughout the US. However, most of the hashtags used by these groups are group-specific and referring to the group’s primary cause namely #lgbtq, #transgender, #queeringrepro and #nonbinary. A lot of the tweets using the aforementioned hashtags deal with the fact that the organizations are fearfull that the overturnment of Roe vs. Wade will be followed by other more conservative legislation that will deprive LGBTQ2S+ people of other reproductive rights such as fertility treatment. This is for instance seen in the tweet below:
- "Repro tech is at risk for LGBTQ families!🔬 State Senator @ZachWahls tells us about how his two moms used artificial reproductive technology (ART) to have children and create a family.🟣 Why do you think politicians are trying to put an end to LGBTQ families?"

Thereby, the abortion debate is both relevant for these groups, since they fear for the rights and health of those LGBTQ2S+ people who are pregnant, but also because they fear if these people will be able to receive help to get pregnant in the future. 

#### Top tweets

Below is shown 3 of the 10 most liked tweets from these groups on the abortion issue. From these tweets it is also evident that the LGBTQ2S+ groups are definitely seeing the abortion issue as an issue for their target group. As mentioned in the hashtag section the groups are also worried how this will affect future Supreme Court decisions on LGBTQ2S+ people’s rights. This is also seen in the tweet on the right, where it is mentioned that one of the Supreme Court justices, Justice Thomas, had spoken som “alarming” words on other rulings (Obergefell v. Hodges and Lawrence v. Texas). These specific rulings are essential for LGBTQ2S+ people’s guaranteed right to same-sex marriage. This tweets thus clearly shows that these groups see the abortion issue as an issue that can lead to other subsequent negative effects on their target group in the future.
