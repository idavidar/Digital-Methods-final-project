# US Abortion Debate: how do different groups frame the abortion issue?
Group project in Digital Methods by Ida Vidar Kristensen, Faridoddin Pesteh and Ana Radomirescu
## Introduction
Research question: In our group project we worked on how different groups/organizations in the US discussed and framed the “abortion issue” specifically during and after the overturning of Roe v. Wade on the 24th of June 2022. We wanted to look at different American organizations that fight for different issues and see how they framed the subject. We wanted first and foremost to look at the distinction between pro-choice and pro-life groups (which clearly have different stances on the matter), but also at how other relevant equity seeking groups and religious groups frames the issue, and whether they speak about the issue in a way that promotes and reflects the subject they normally lobby for. 
We have chosen to examine the tweets of 10 organizational accounts affiliated with 5 different subgroups (50 groups in total:
- Pro-choice (pro-abortion)
- Pro-life (anti-abortion)
- LGBTQ2S+ groups (organizations seeking for people with different sexual orientations, genders etc.)
- Minority groups (here specifically racial minorities. So groups that fight for the rights of afro-americans, Latino-americans and asian-americans).
- Religious groups (groups representing the different religions who represent the american population - christians, catholics, jewish, muslim etc.)
## Historical background
The contextual background of our analysis is the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe vs. Wade on June 24th 2022, and thus removing abortion as a constitutional right throughout the US. After the overturnment it is now up to the politicians in each individual state to determine the states laws on abortion - this decision has so far entailed that 12 states have made total abortion bans and that many other states have tightened their abortion policies. 
The timeline of the events can be seen below. 
- 1973: Roe vs. Wade was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court (1973: Abortion was legalized throughout the US
- May 3rd, 2022: Leaked Draft: On May 3, a leaked draft opinion by Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito indicated that the Court would strike down the landmark Roe v. Wade decision, which guaranteed federal constitutional protections of abortion rights.
- June 24th, 2022: Roe vs. Wade overturned by the Supreme Court: Abortion is no longer a constitutional right.
